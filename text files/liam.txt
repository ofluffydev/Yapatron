Let's transform a 0 point 0 1 square meter space into a functional house. Liam lived frugally and worked diligently for two years managing to save up half a million to buy a house in New York. However, upon moving in, he was shocked by how small it was. He couldn't even stretch out his fingers. Now, let's explore how we can help Liam transform it into a functional home. First, we'll construct a durable frame using galvanized square steel anchored firmly to the wall with expansion screws filled with grid steel bars and concrete for lasting strength. We'll also install thermally broken aluminum windows, expanding the living space by 2 square meters. Next, we'll build a multifunctional sitting platform on the floor with hidden storage underneath for bulky items, saving precious space and providing a seating area for Liam and his girlfriend. This platform doubles as a comfortable bed that can sleep two, surrounded by cushion panels in lucky colors for a better rest. We'll add a movable table on the bed to serve as both a workspace and dining area, with an outlet switch nearby for charging devices, making it perfect for work and meals. After use, the table can be stored beside the bed, keeping the space organized. We'll then construct a bedframe from galvanized square steel, enhancing its appearance with wood veneers. Incorporate a pre-buried drainage system for convenience. Build a set of wall cabinets with a counter top drilled to embed a sink. Underneath, install a build in washing-machine to keep dirty laundry at bay. Convert the counter top for dual use by placing an induction cooker for cooking, and install a mirror cabinet above. Next to the mirror, add a cabinet for spices and toiletries. Install a shower head on the wall and an enlarged stand, allowing even space to ride a horse while showering.
